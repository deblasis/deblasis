Always learning something new from all you smart folks and then pretend that I came up with something on my own. 
Well, at least I am honest!

I would consider myself the strongest in **C#** and **Javascript** but maybe these "muscles" will lose volume in favour of Go as I keep hitting "the gym" ðŸ˜‰ 

Currently I am building mostly in **Go** but I can't stop typing 

```bash
dotnet run something
```
or 

```bash
python3 -m venv somethingelse
```

or 

```bash
npm run start
```

or
```bash
make somethingIamSickOfTypingOverAndOverAgain
```
because I have too much _diverse_ stuff running around!

Don't try to suggest something horrible. They are pets, not cattle. The trauma would be too much to handle. ðŸ˜†

My frontend framework of choice is ReactJS but Blazor is pretty cool too, check it out if you don't hate .Net. 
Along the way I used Angular and also Aurelia.

Testing: can't live without but sometimes you gotta cut corners, am I right?

Ok now you hate me, it was a brief but intense interaction. Thanks! ðŸ˜‰
