# Ciao! I am Alex üëã Howdy?

I have built many things over the years, learning and using various languages and frameworks.

What was a skill is now quickly becoming ballast.

If I distill all my knowledge I should still be able to command an army of mini-mes.

The experience, the mistakes made and the ability to figure things out without StackOverflow, YouTube, LLMs will be forever useful.

## Connect with me

I mostly shitpost about financial markets, tech, with the occasional rant/self-reflection and the odd burst of jokes and memes in these areas.
