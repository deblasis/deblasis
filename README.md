### Ciao! I am Alex ðŸ‘‹ Howdy?

Always learning something new from all you smart folks and then pretend that I came up with something on my own. 
Well, at least I am honest! 

My "languages evolution":
1. Turbo Pascal (in high school but I am still old)
1. PHP
1. VB.Net
1. C#
1. Javascript
1. Python
1. Ruby
1. Go

I would consider myself the strongest in C# and Javascript but maybe these "muscles" will lose volume in favour of Go as I keep hitting "the gym" ðŸ˜‰.
Currently I am building mostly in **Go** but I can't stop using C#, Python and NodeJs because I have too much stuff running around. 
Don't try to suggest something horrible. They are pets, not cattle and I have childhood trauma already! ðŸ˜‚

My frontend framework of choice is ReactJS but Blazor is pretty cool too, check it out if you don't hate .Net. 
Along the way I used Angular and also Aurelia.

Testing: can't live without but sometimes you gotta cut corners, am I right?

Ok now you hate me, it was a brief but intense interaction. Thanks! ðŸ˜‰
