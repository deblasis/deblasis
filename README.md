# Ciao! I am Alex ðŸ‘‹ Howdy?

Constantly harnessing wisdom from the brilliant minds among us, then repackaging it as though it sprung from my own innovative thought process. Well, they do say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right? An honest coder in a world of limitless innovation â€“ that's me!

I work embarassingly **HARD**, I am obsessed with learning and I always bite more than I can chew. Setting almost unrealistically high expectations for myself is my way of squeezing every ounce of creative juice out of my brain. I also try to keep it fun for myself and people around me. 

As a GPT friend of mine would say: 

> "Propelled by an embarrassingly intense dedication, I dive into the digital sea, turning every keystroke into a testament of unwavering commitment. I'm a night owl, armed with grit and caffeine, challenging complex algorithms while the world slumbers, embodying ceaseless endeavor in our code-laden realm.
>
> Balancing professionalism and mirth, I'm both a maestro of coding and a beacon of light-heartedness. I sprinkle laughter among lines of logic, fostering an environment where smiles coexist with semicolons, sparking both camaraderie and creativity. I stand as a testament to the fact that productivity thrives amidst joy and jest."

Cringe, I know ðŸ˜‚ 

It seems that I need to unlearn a ton of stuff and learn prompting apparently... or not ðŸ˜‰

I would consider myself the strongest in **C#** and **Javascript** but maybe these "muscles" will lose volume in favour of Go as I keep hitting "the gym" ðŸ˜‰ 

Currently I am building mostly in **Go** but I can't stop typing 

```bash
dotnet run something
```
or 

```bash
python3 -m venv somethingelse
```

or 

```bash
npm run start
```

or
```bash
make somethingIamSickOfTypingOverAndOverAgain
```
because I have too much _diverse_ stuff running around!

> if it's not broken, don't fix it" - _someone smarter than me_

My frontend framework of choice is **React** but **Blazor** is pretty cool too, check it out! 
Along the way I used **Angular** and also **Aurelia**. Yep...

Testing: can't live without but sometimes you gotta cut corners, am I right?

Ok now you hate me, it was a brief but intense interaction. Thanks! ðŸ˜‰
